This is the i-RMSD code for calculating the p53&MDM2 complex. 

The interface residues are defined as residues in MDM2 which locate within 1nm from the peptide. The residue distance used here is closest-heavy.

The alignement and rotation template is crystal strucutre of MDM2&p53(1yrc).

The unit of Y-axis is nm.
